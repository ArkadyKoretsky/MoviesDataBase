<a name="Search_Query">

### 1. Search Query

Each time the user starts to write something at the search bar he\she gets the results right away.<br/>
As you might notice the search word highlighted for each movie title and the results are sorted by ascending release date:<br/>

### 2. Filter by Year

If you wish, you have the option to see only the movies released at specific year.<br/>
The years you see at the drop down are the only ones related to the search query.
